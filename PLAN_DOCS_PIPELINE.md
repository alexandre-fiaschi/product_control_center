# Docs Pipeline — Plan

Status: **design / brainstorm**. No code yet. This document captures the design for the release-notes (docs) side of the pipeline so we can build it in clean blocks without re-deciding things mid-flight.

---

## 1. Scope and guiding principles

The docs pipeline turns a published Zendesk release-note PDF into a CAE-templated DOCX, attaches it to the same patch entry as the binaries, and runs it through its own approval + Jira flow.

**Guiding principles**

1. **Binaries on SFTP are the single source of truth.** A patch exists because SFTP says so. Release notes are an *attribute* of an existing patch — never the other way around. If Zendesk has notes for a version we've never seen on SFTP, we ignore it (log a warning).
2. **Two independent tracks per patch.** `binaries` and `release_notes` are already separate sub-objects in the state model with their own status, their own approval, and their own Jira ticket. The docs pipeline plugs into the existing `release_notes` slot — no schema split.
3. **Idempotent state machine.** "Retry" is not a separate concept — it's just running the discovery step again on a patch whose status is in a retry-eligible state. Same code path as the first try.
4. **No new infrastructure.** Same JSON state files, same orchestrator pattern, same approval endpoint shape as binaries.

---

## 2. The three blocks

The work splits cleanly into three blocks. They depend on each other in order, but block A and block B can be prototyped in parallel against fixtures.

### Block A — Release-notes discovery + download (Zendesk)

**Goal:** given a patch like `8.1.16.1`, find the matching release-note PDF on Zendesk and download it locally.

**Inputs:** patch version string, product family.

**Outputs:**
- A PDF saved under `patches/<product>/<version>/release_notes/<filename>.pdf`.
- State transition on `release_notes`: `not_started → discovered → downloaded`.
- New fields on `ReleaseNotesState`: `source_pdf_path`, `source_url`, `source_published_at`.

**Naming convention to test (Alex confirmed this is standard):**
- File: `8.0.16.1 - Release Notes.pdf`
- Category: `8.0.16` — opening the category lists all `8.0.16.x` patches.

**Matching logic:**
1. Resolve category by `<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>` (e.g. `8.1.16`).
2. Within the category, look for an article whose title or attachment filename starts with the full patch version (`8.1.16.1`).
3. Download the first PDF attachment matching the pattern.

**Already-built reference:** [scripts/test_zendesk_scraper.py](scripts/test_zendesk_scraper.py) — proves curl_cffi + legacy `/access/login` works around Cloudflare. Code lifts cleanly into `backend/app/integrations/zendesk.py`.

**Failure modes** (how each maps to the two state machines — see section 3):

- **Article doesn't exist yet** (notes published late) → **workflow status** `not_found`, **run status** `success`. Not a failure, just a clean negative result. **Not auto-retried** by future main scans — recovery is via the manual "Refetch Release Notes" button or a future email webhook (see section 4.0 for why).
- **Login or scraping breaks** (Cloudflare, expired creds, network blip, broken HTML) → **workflow status untouched** (stays whatever it was before the attempt), **run status** `failed` with `step` and `error` populated. Full traceback also logged. Since workflow status didn't change, the next main scan will retry only if the patch was still in `not_started` (i.e. the failure happened on its very first attempt). Otherwise recovery is manual.
- **Found multiple matches** → **workflow status** `not_found` (don't guess, don't pick one). **Run status** `success` (the attempt itself completed fine). Distinct log event `zendesk.fetch.ambiguous_match` instead of `zendesk.fetch.no_match` so it's greppable. Only introduce a dedicated workflow state if ambiguous matches become recurring in practice.

**The principle:** workflow status describes the patch's place in the business process; run status describes what happened on the last attempt. Exceptions modify run status, never workflow status. See section 3.

---

### Block B — DOCX template injection (PDF → CAE DOCX)

**Goal:** take the downloaded source PDF and produce a CAE-templated DOCX ready for review.

**Inputs:** path to source PDF, path to CAE template.

**Outputs:**
- DOCX saved under `patches/<product>/<version>/release_notes/<filename>.docx`.
- State transition: `downloaded → converted`.
- New fields on `ReleaseNotesState`: `generated_docx_path`, `template_version`.

**Lives at:** `backend/app/pipelines/docs/converter.py` — replaces the current stub.

**Risk:** this is the highest-risk block. Plumbing is easy; conversion fidelity is the unknown. Worth prototyping standalone (same way the Zendesk scraper was) before wiring into the pipeline. Questions to answer in the prototype, **not** here:
- Does the PDF have stable structure (headings, tables) we can extract, or is it a flat layout?
- Does the CAE template need section markers / placeholders, or is it just styling?
- What's the fallback when extraction is partial — empty section, or fail the conversion?

**Re-conversion:** if the template is updated, we need a way to re-run conversion on every `pending_approval` doc without re-downloading the PDF. Same idempotency principle — re-running the converter step on a `converted` or `pending_approval` patch should be safe and overwrite the DOCX.

---

### Block C — Merge into the existing approval flow

**Goal:** make the docs track behave like the binaries track in the orchestrator, the API, and the UI — while keeping their approvals fully independent.

> **Block C is a category, not a unit of work.** It covers orchestrator, API, UI, and approval semantics. Each of those is broken down into a separate PR-sized unit in [§7](#7-build-plan--prs). This sub-section keeps the design intent only; for *what gets built and in what order*, see §7 — that's the source of truth.

**Design intent (the parts that aren't mechanical):**
- The existing `approve` endpoint stays one endpoint. Same contract, request body targets `binaries` *or* `release_notes`.
- A main scan is the three-pass flow from §4.0. The docs pass auto-acts on `not_started` only — never `not_found` (see §4.2 for the asymmetry).
- The existing [Pipeline.tsx](frontend/src/views/Pipeline.tsx) table is already structured right: one row per patch, two status-badge columns, two approval buttons. **All UI changes are additive** — workflow status badges stay exactly as they are. Filter bar, history table, approval modal, overall layout: unchanged.
- Approving binaries and approving docs are still independent buttons / endpoints / Jira tickets. The docs side has one extra final step: after approval, convert the approved DOCX to PDF and attach *that* to the docs Jira ticket. State: `approved → pdf_exported → published`.

---

## 3. State model — two orthogonal state machines per track

This is the central design decision. Every track on every patch (binaries and release_notes) has **two independent state machines** that answer different questions and have different lifetimes:

| | **Workflow status** | **Run status** |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** | "Where is this track in the business process?" | "What did the latest attempt do?" |
| **Lifetime** | Lives for the life of the patch (days / weeks) | Lives for one attempt (seconds / minutes) |
| **Changed by** | Business events (discovered, downloaded, approved, published) | The execution engine (started, succeeded, failed) |
| **Resets?** | Never (monotonic; explicit rollback would be a future feature) | Every new attempt overwrites it |
| **`failed` as a value?** | **Never.** Errors don't belong in a workflow state machine. | **Yes, naturally** — it describes the attempt, not the patch. |

This is the standard pattern in every production system that runs long-lived objects through repeated attempts: GitHub Actions (PR vs workflow run), Airflow (DAG vs task instance), Stripe (payment intent vs charge attempt), Kubernetes (Deployment vs Pod). Run-state failures don't corrupt workflow state.

### 3.1 Workflow status

**`BinariesState.status`** (unchanged from today):
```
discovered → downloaded → pending_approval → approved → published
```

**`ReleaseNotesState.status`** (one new value: `not_found`):
```
not_started ─┬─ discovered → downloaded → converted → pending_approval → approved → pdf_exported → published
             │
             └─ not_found  ◀── Zendesk lookup ran cleanly, no matching article yet
```

`not_found` is the only addition. It means "we looked, Zendesk doesn't have it yet" — a soft, expected outcome since notes are often published after the binaries land on SFTP. Re-entered from `not_started` and exited back to `discovered` on a future successful scan.

**Workflow status contains no error values.** Ever. Errors are described by run status.

### 3.2 Run status

A new sub-object `last_run` attached to *both* `BinariesState` and `ReleaseNotesState`:

```python
class LastRun(BaseModel):
    state: Literal["idle", "running", "success", "failed"] = "idle"
    started_at: datetime | None = None
    finished_at: datetime | None = None
    step: str | None = None         # free-form, e.g. "zendesk_login", "pdf_download"
    error: str | None = None        # one-line error summary for triage
```

- `idle` — never been attempted (initial value)
- `running` — an attempt is in progress right now. Also acts as the per-cell lock: any other trigger seeing `running` skips.
- `success` — last attempt completed without exception (regardless of whether it found/changed anything)
- `failed` — last attempt raised an exception. `step` and `error` are populated. **Can happen at any step for any reason** — the two fields tell you which.

**`step` is free-form string.** Same value is also emitted in the log line, so there's one source of truth. Free-form means adding a new step tomorrow doesn't require a migration.

### 3.3 Putting both state machines together

Updated Pydantic models:

```python
class LastRun(BaseModel):
    state: Literal["idle", "running", "success", "failed"] = "idle"
    started_at: datetime | None = None
    finished_at: datetime | None = None
    step: str | None = None
    error: str | None = None


class BinariesState(BaseModel):
    status: Literal["discovered", "downloaded", "pending_approval",
                    "approved", "published"] = "discovered"
    last_run: LastRun = LastRun()
    # + existing timestamps, jira fields


class ReleaseNotesState(BaseModel):
    status: Literal["not_started", "discovered", "downloaded", "converted",
                    "pending_approval", "approved", "pdf_exported", "published",
                    "not_found"] = "not_started"
    last_run: LastRun = LastRun()
    # + existing timestamps, jira fields
```

A patch discovered from a scan produces **four independent cells**:
- `patch.binaries.status` (workflow) + `patch.binaries.last_run` (run)
- `patch.release_notes.status` (workflow) + `patch.release_notes.last_run` (run)

All four progress independently. Binaries can be `approved` while docs are `not_found`, and at the same moment binaries can have `last_run.state = success` while docs have `last_run.state = failed`. That's not a contradiction — it's the whole point.

### 3.4 State transitions during an attempt

The lifecycle of every attempt (binaries or docs) is the same five steps:

1. **Pre-flight check:** if `last_run.state == running`, skip this attempt (another worker is already on it).
2. **Start:** set `last_run.state = running`, `last_run.started_at = now()`, clear `step` and `error`.
3. **Execute:** do the work, updating `last_run.step` as the attempt progresses through named steps.
4. **On success:**
   - Set `last_run.state = success`, `last_run.finished_at = now()`.
   - Advance `status` (workflow) if appropriate — e.g. docs fetch `not_started → discovered`, or `not_started → not_found` on clean negative.
5. **On exception:**
   - Set `last_run.state = failed`, `last_run.finished_at = now()`, populate `last_run.step` and `last_run.error`.
   - **Do not touch `status`** (workflow) — it stays whatever it was before the attempt.
   - Emit a full structured log line with traceback.

Next attempt starts from step 1. When it begins, `last_run.state` flips back to `running` and the previous failure is naturally overwritten. No manual "clear error" button needed — success self-heals.

### 3.5 Why this two-machine model is the right call

**Why workflow status has no `failed`:**
- Workflow status describes *the patch's place in the business process*. A failed attempt doesn't move the patch backward in the process — it just means "the last attempt didn't complete". Encoding that as a workflow state would conflate "business stage" with "execution outcome".
- Status fields that try to encode debugging info age badly: they drift from logs, and you end up with two sources of truth for the same information.
- The UI needs to filter by business stage ("show me all `pending_approval` patches") without those filters being polluted by attempt outcomes.

**Why run status earns its place as a separate machine:**
- It gives the UI a direct signal for "this cell is currently working" (spinner) and "this cell's last attempt broke" (red dot + tooltip) without polluting workflow status.
- `step` and `error` give Alex enough triage info to decide "retry, investigate, or ignore" without opening a log file for 80% of cases. The other 20% still grep logs — the two systems cooperate, not compete.
- `last_run.state == running` is a natural per-cell lock without needing a separate lock table.
- It resets cleanly on every attempt, which matches how execution engines think about work.

**Why this maps to industry patterns:**
- GitHub Actions: PR has workflow state, each run has `queued/in_progress/success/failure`. A failed run doesn't mark the PR as errored.
- Airflow / Dagster / Prefect: DAG has definition, task instances have `scheduled/running/success/failed/up_for_retry`.
- Stripe: payment intent has lifecycle, each charge attempt has its own outcome.
- Every serious long-running job system works this way. Future contributors will recognize it immediately.

## 4. Scans and retriggers

### 4.0 Main scan flow

A main scan is **three sequential passes over the same state**, each independent. SFTP discovery writes new patches to state *before* any download happens — the moment a patch is discovered, it exists in the system as a tracked entity, with `binaries.status = discovered` and `release_notes.status = not_started`. From that moment on, the two tracks progress independently.

```
POST /scan (main scan):

  1. SFTP DISCOVERY
     ─ list SFTP, find new patches
     ─ write to state immediately:
         binaries.status      = discovered
         release_notes.status = not_started
     ─ the patch is now tracked, even though nothing is downloaded yet

  2. BINARIES PASS — for each cell where binaries.status == discovered
                     AND last_run.state != "running":
     ─ run the per-cell lifecycle (section 3.4)
     ─ on success: binaries.status moves discovered → downloaded → pending_approval
     ─ on failure: binaries.last_run.state = failed, workflow status untouched

  3. DOCS PASS — for each cell where release_notes.status == not_started
                 AND last_run.state != "running":
     ─ run the per-cell lifecycle — fetch from Zendesk
     ─ if found:        status moves not_started → discovered → downloaded → ...
     ─ if cleanly not:  status = not_found, run state = success
     ─ if exception:    run state = failed, workflow status untouched

  4. Persist scan record to state/scans.json with counts for each pass.
```

**Critical: the docs pass auto-acts on `not_started` only, NEVER on `not_found`.**

This is the most important rule in the docs pipeline and it's worth being loud about.

The naive approach would be to also auto-retry `not_found` patches on every scan ("maybe the notes are published now"). That's the **trap**: every cron tick would re-hit Zendesk for every patch still missing notes, and the eligibility set grows monotonically as the backlog accumulates. One misconfigured backoff away from getting the scraper IP blocked. Linear-in-backlog load on a third-party Cloudflare-protected site is exactly what you don't want.

Instead: **publishing release notes is the developer's job, not the cron's job to keep guessing.** When notes are published, the recovery mechanism is explicit human (or future automated) action, not blind polling:

- **Today:** Alex sees `not_found` in the UI and clicks the "Refetch Release Notes" action button on that row.
- **Future:** an email webhook (or any other "notes are now available" signal) hits the targeted refetch endpoint. Same code path, no design change.

Auto-fetch acts on patches that have **never been tried** (`not_started`); manual / future-webhook acts on patches that have been tried and came up empty (`not_found`). Two different intent levels, two different trigger mechanisms, one shared per-cell lifecycle.

**Why three sequential passes and not interleaved:**
- A binaries failure in pass 2 does not block the docs pass for the same patch — the two tracks are independent at the cell level.
- Sequential passes keep logs readable and isolate external-system blast radius (SFTP issues vs Zendesk issues). Parallelizing later is a small change if scan volume ever demands it.

### 4.1 Two kinds of scan

These are different enough that they get different endpoints, different log namespaces, and different locking rules:

| | **Main scan** | **Targeted docs fetch** |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Walks SFTP, discovers new patches, fans out to binaries download + docs fetch for everything new or retry-eligible | One (or N) specific known patch(es). Does not touch SFTP. |
| **Trigger** | Cron or "Start scan" button | UI row action or bulk version-header button |
| **Endpoint** | `POST /scan` | `POST /patches/{id}/release-notes/refetch` (single), `POST /scan/release-notes?version=...` (bulk) |
| **Log namespace** | `scan.main.*` | `zendesk.fetch.*` (direct, no `scan.*` wrapping) |
| **Locking** | Rejects if another main scan is running (409 Conflict) | Allowed during a main scan, because the per-cell lock (`last_run.state == running`) prevents double-work on the same cell |
| **Purpose** | Discover + progress everything in one sweep | "I know this specific patch needs its notes — don't make me wait for the next cron tick" |

The targeted fetch reuses the same Zendesk code internally, but it's a different workflow: the main scan discovers new work, the targeted fetch acts on a specific known cell. Don't conflate them.

### 4.2 Retrigger — three layers, one code path

All three layers call the same per-cell attempt function. The state is the queue — there is no separate retry table. The key asymmetry is **what counts as eligible** depending on who's triggering.

| Layer | Trigger | Eligible cells | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Auto on main scan** | Every `POST /scan` (cron or manual) | `release_notes.status == not_started` AND `last_run.state != running` | First-look only. Acts on patches that have never been tried. Bounded by definition — `not_found` is excluded so the eligibility set doesn't grow with the backlog. |
| **Per-row manual** | UI "Refetch Release Notes" action button on a single patch | `release_notes.status ∈ {not_started, not_found}` AND `last_run.state != running` | Alex (or a future webhook) saying "look again now, the developer just published". Explicit human intent — `not_found` is fair game here. |
| **Bulk** | Version-header button or filtered API call (`POST /scan/release-notes?version=...`) | same as per-row manual | Same explicit-intent semantics, but for a batch — e.g. "Refetch all missing notes in V8.1" after the developer announced a doc drop. |

**Eligibility check pseudocode:**
```python
def is_eligible(cell, trigger):
    if cell.last_run.state == "running":
        return False  # per-cell lock — another worker is on it
    if trigger == "auto_scan":
        return cell.status == "not_started"
    else:  # manual or bulk
        return cell.status in {"not_started", "not_found"}
```

**Why no backoff window.** Earlier draft had a backoff timer. Removed because the only thing being auto-retried is `not_started` — and a patch can only be `not_started` *before* its first attempt. By definition, there's nothing to back off from. Manual / bulk triggers represent explicit human intent and don't need rate-limiting either (Alex is the rate limiter). Backoff was solving a problem that no longer exists once `not_found` is removed from the auto-retry set.

**Failed-run cells are a separate question.** If a patch's last attempt threw an exception (`last_run.state == failed`) but workflow status is still `not_started`, the next main scan will pick it up automatically (it's still `not_started`, after all). If we ever need to slow that down, we add backoff *only* for cells with `last_run.state == failed` — but that's a v2 concern, not v1.

**Critical:** do not introduce a separate retry table or queue. Workflow status + run status + `last_run` timestamps already encode "what needs retrying" and "when it was last tried". Two sources of truth is how you end up debugging state drift instead of debugging bugs.

### 4.2.1 The future email-webhook trigger

When the team eventually wants automated "notes are now published" signals, they plug into the **same targeted refetch endpoint** the manual button uses. No design change — just a new trigger calling existing code:

```
[email arrives] → [webhook handler parses version] → POST /patches/{id}/release-notes/refetch
                                                       ↑
                                            same endpoint as the UI button
```

This is why the docs pass deliberately doesn't try to be clever about `not_found` polling: the moment there's a real signal (email, Slack, manual click), it goes through the targeted endpoint. The auto-on-scan path stays narrow and safe.

### 4.3 Scan history

We persist a record of every scan to `state/scans.json` (or `state/scans/<scan_id>.json` — TBD, pick whichever serializes cleaner). Each record captures:

```python
class ScanRecord(BaseModel):
    scan_id: str
    trigger: Literal["cron", "manual", "targeted", "bulk_docs"]
    started_at: datetime
    finished_at: datetime | None         # null while in-flight → acts as "is a scan running?" signal
    products: list[str]                  # products covered
    counts: dict[str, int]               # e.g. patches_total, binaries_new, release_notes_found,
                                         #      release_notes_not_found, release_notes_failed
    duration_ms: int | None
```

**Why:**
- `finished_at IS NULL` is the "main scan running" signal for the 409 Conflict check.
- Persisted history lets the UI later show "last 10 scans" and aggregate outcomes without parsing log files.
- Gives a durable audit trail independent of log rotation.

**Not in v1:** no UI for scan history yet. The data is recorded now so the UI can be added later without a migration.

---

## 5. Open questions to decide before building

These are decisions, not unknowns. Each one needs a yes/no before the relevant block starts.

1. **Block A:** Are Zendesk article titles 100% standardized to `<version> - Release Notes.pdf`, or do we need fuzzy matching? → check 5–10 real articles across V7.3, V8.0, V8.1.
2. **Block A:** What's the auth model — service account credentials in `.env`, same as Jira? → confirm Alex pastes credentials himself per the standing rule.
3. **Block B:** Run a standalone PDF→DOCX prototype against 3 representative real PDFs *before* wiring into the pipeline. If fidelity is bad, the whole plan changes (e.g. we may end up with a "human edits the DOCX" loop instead of full auto).
4. **Block C:** DOCX preview in browser — v1 is "download to review" or do we invest in HTML rendering up front?
5. **State:** Do we retrofit `last_run` onto existing state JSON files in one migration step, or lazily default to `idle` on load? Lazy is simpler but means no historical run data until the first attempt.
6. **State:** Scan history storage — single `state/scans.json` file (simple, gets large) or `state/scans/<scan_id>.json` (many small files, rotation-friendly)?

---

## 6. Out of scope for this plan

- Rejecting a release note (rollback path). The binaries side doesn't have it either; we'll add both together later.
- Notifications (Slack/email when new notes are found and waiting for approval).
- Diffing two versions of release notes for the same patch (rare; manual for now).
- Anything in `templates/` beyond the single CAE doc template.

---

## 7. Build plan — PRs

The work is split into **11 PR-sized units**. Every unit produces **one PR**, **one git commit**, and **passing tests** (`cd backend && pytest tests/ -v -k "not integration"` for backend; `cd frontend && npm run build` for frontend). Each unit is small enough to brief a single agent on without ambiguity.

**Conventions for every unit:**
- Each unit has a clearly stated **scope**, list of **files**, **tests**, **dependencies**, and **done criteria**.
- An agent picks up one unit at a time, opens a branch, implements it, runs the test command listed, and commits.
- No unit modifies more than its listed files unless a dependency was missed (in which case: stop and update this plan first).
- Logs in every backend unit follow the convention defined in unit 0.

**Dependency graph:**

```
0 ──► 1 ──► 2 ──► 3 ──► 5 ──► 6 ──► 7 ──► 8 ──► 9 ──► 10
                  │     ▲
                  └─────┘
              4 (parallel — gate before 5)
```

Unit 4 (Block B prototype) is the only one that runs **in parallel** with the rest. It gates unit 5 (don't integrate the converter until the prototype proves DOCX fidelity is acceptable).

---

### Unit 0 — Logging convention + binaries logging retrofit + IOError fix

**Effort:** Small.
**Depends on:** nothing.

**Scope.** Establish the logging convention used by every later unit, retrofit existing binaries code to it as a worked example, and fix one swallowed-exception bug along the way. No new features.

**Files:**
- [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) — add a one-paragraph "Logging convention" section: events use `subsystem.action.outcome` naming, payload uses `key=value` greppable fields, exceptions use `exc_info=True`, document the standard fields (`product`, `version`, `step`).
- [backend/app/services/orchestrator.py](backend/app/services/orchestrator.py) — convert existing log calls to the new convention. Add a per-patch summary line and a per-scan summary line (counts of new / downloaded / failed).
- [backend/app/pipelines/binaries/fetcher.py](backend/app/pipelines/binaries/fetcher.py) — convert log calls; **fix the bug at line 32**: `IOError` is currently swallowed (returns 0, logs an error, but the caller treats it as success). Re-raise instead so the caller's `try/except` actually sees the failure.

**Tests.** Add a unit test that simulates `_download_recursive` raising `IOError` and asserts the orchestrator catches it (today's behavior is the bug — the orchestrator never sees it). Run full backend suite.

**Done criteria:** all 121 existing tests + new test pass; binaries logs in the new format; HANDOFF.md has the convention paragraph.

---

### Unit 1 — State model foundation

**Effort:** Small.
**Depends on:** unit 0.

**Scope.** Add `LastRun` Pydantic model; add `last_run` field to both `BinariesState` and `ReleaseNotesState`; add `not_found` value to `ReleaseNotesState.status` Literal. **No `ScanRecord` yet — that lives in unit 6 where it has somewhere to be exercised.** Migration is **lazy default on load** (Pydantic default value handles existing JSON files automatically).

**Files:**
- [backend/app/state/models.py](backend/app/state/models.py) — add `LastRun`, add `last_run: LastRun = LastRun()` to both states, extend the release notes Literal.

**Tests.**
- Round-trip: load each existing fixture under [state/patches/](state/patches/), confirm it parses with default `last_run` populated, write it back, confirm bytewise (or semantic) round-trip.
- New `not_found` value parses cleanly.
- Default `LastRun()` has `state == "idle"` and all timestamp fields `None`.

**Done criteria:** all existing tests + new model tests pass; existing state JSON files load without modification.

---

### Unit 2 — Lifecycle helper + binaries retrofit

**Effort:** Medium.
**Depends on:** unit 1.

**Scope.** Implement the per-cell 5-step lifecycle from §3.4 as a single helper. Retrofit the existing binaries download to use it. Binaries gain `last_run` tracking automatically — **no new endpoints, no UI changes**. This is the foundation every later pipeline (docs fetch, converter) reuses.

**Files:**
- `backend/app/services/lifecycle.py` (new) — `run_cell(cell, work_fn, *, step_name)` helper. Pre-flight lock check → set `running` + `started_at` → call `work_fn` → on return set `success` + `finished_at`, on exception set `failed` + `finished_at` + `step` + `error` (one-line summary). Returns success/failure indicator.
- [backend/app/services/orchestrator.py](backend/app/services/orchestrator.py) — wrap the existing binaries download call in `run_cell`. Workflow status transitions stay where they are; the helper only manages `last_run`.

**Tests.**
- Successful run → `last_run.state == "success"`, `started_at` and `finished_at` set, no `step`/`error`.
- Failing run (work_fn raises) → `state == "failed"`, `step` and `error` populated.
- Lock case: call `run_cell` on a cell whose `last_run.state` is already `"running"` → returns immediately, doesn't run `work_fn`.

**Done criteria:** existing binaries download tests still pass; new lifecycle tests pass; binaries run records are visible in the JSON state file after a scan.

### Unit 3 — Block A: Zendesk fetcher

**Effort:** Medium.
**Depends on:** unit 2.

**Scope.** Extract the standalone Zendesk scraper from [scripts/test_zendesk_scraper.py](scripts/test_zendesk_scraper.py) into `backend/app/integrations/zendesk.py`. Build `backend/app/pipelines/docs/fetcher.py` that takes a patch and uses the integration to look up the matching release-notes article. Wire into the orchestrator as the docs pass (third pass — see §4.0). **Auto-acts on `not_started` only**, never `not_found`. All Zendesk calls go through `run_cell` from unit 2.

**Files:**
- `backend/app/integrations/zendesk.py` (new) — `ZendeskClient` class: login, find article by version, download PDF. No business logic, just integration.
- `backend/app/pipelines/docs/fetcher.py` (new) — `fetch_release_notes(patch)`: calls the client, on success downloads PDF + transitions workflow status `not_started → discovered → downloaded`, on clean-negative transitions to `not_found`, on exception lets the lifecycle helper record the failure.
- [backend/app/services/orchestrator.py](backend/app/services/orchestrator.py) — add the docs pass after the binaries pass. Behind a config flag (`pipeline.docs.enabled`) so it can be turned off if Zendesk is unstable.
- [backend/app/pipelines/docs/stub.py](backend/app/pipelines/docs/stub.py) — delete (replaced by `fetcher.py`).

**Tests.**
- Fixture-based tests with recorded HTTP responses (no live calls in CI). Cover: login success, article found + PDF downloaded, article not found (clean negative → `not_found`), Cloudflare 403 (exception → `last_run.state == failed`), ambiguous match (multiple candidates → `not_found` + warning log event).
- Orchestrator integration test: run a full main scan against fixture state, confirm binaries pass and docs pass both run, both update their respective `last_run`.

**Done criteria:** main scan finds and downloads at least one real release-note PDF in dev (manual smoke test); fixture tests cover all five failure modes; existing tests still pass.

### Unit 4 — Block B prototype (standalone, parallel) — GATE BEFORE UNIT 5

**Effort:** Small–Medium.
**Depends on:** nothing — runs in parallel with units 0–3.
**Status:** In progress — first iteration shipped, fidelity still below acceptable workflow. Verdict deferred until additional iterations.

**Scope.** Standalone PDF → CAE-templated DOCX prototype. **Not wired into the pipeline.** Goal is to answer: *is the conversion fidelity good enough to ship?* If yes, unit 5 wires it in. If no, the docs pipeline becomes a "human edits the DOCX in Word" loop and the rest of the plan changes shape.

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_docx_conversion.py` (new) — takes a PDF path + template path, produces a DOCX. Same standalone-script style as `test_zendesk_scraper.py`.

**Tests.** Manual eyeball with Alex on **3 representative real PDFs** (one per product family if possible — V7.3, V8.0, V8.1). Document the verdict in the PR description: structure preserved? styles applied? sections in the right order? what's broken? what's acceptable?

**Done criteria:** 3 sample DOCX outputs reviewed with Alex; explicit go/no-go decision recorded in the PR. If no-go, the plan §2 Block B and units 5/9/10 need to be redesigned before continuing.

**First-iteration findings (2026-04-11) — fast vs hybrid extraction backends:**

- **Two extraction backends** are now supported via `--mode {fast,hybrid}`. Both route through `opendataloader-pdf`. `fast` is the local Java extractor; `hybrid` talks to a local `opendataloader-pdf-hybrid --port 5002` server that runs IBM Docling under the hood (NOT Claude — `opendataloader-pdf` 2.2.1 has no Claude integration despite the speculative `test_hybrid_claude` reference test in `backend/tests/test_pdf_extraction.py`).
- **Java prerequisite:** opendataloader-pdf needs Java 21. On Alex's macOS the runtime is at `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21` and isn't on PATH by default — must export `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21` and `PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH` before running the script.
- **Template strategy validated:** clone-and-fill works. The Flightscape template is a style donor, not a form. The script preserves cover-page artwork (paragraphs 0–37 carry drawings, text boxes, and section breaks) and strips the instructional body (paragraphs 38+) plus all 7 example tables. Cover-page text-box clutter ("If this is your first time…", "Click this text box and delete it", "Update Customer Name…") is wiped via a `<w:txbxContent>` walk that python-docx doesn't expose through `doc.paragraphs`.
- **TOC field is regenerated by Word, not by us.** The template's TOC is an OOXML complex field with cached entries pointing at the original example chapters. We mark the field's begin `<w:fldChar>` `w:dirty="1"` and Word auto-rebuilds it from the actual headings the next time the document is opened (or via right-click → Update Field).
- **Heading hierarchy is pattern-driven, not extractor-driven.** Both extractors mis-classify heading levels (fast judges by font size, hybrid by ML layout). The script overrides extractor decisions for known release-notes structures via `classify_release_note_line`:
  - "Release Features" / "Defect Fixes" / "Not Tested" / etc. → `Heading 1` (these feed the Word TOC's section level)
  - Lines matching `AM\d{2,5}[:\-]` → `Heading 2` (per-item TOC entries)
  - "Bug Description:" / "After correction:" / "Steps to reproduce:" / etc. → **bold body text**, NOT a heading style, so they appear inline under the AM item but DO NOT clutter the TOC (only Heading 1/2/3 styles feed the TOC field by default).
- **fast mode reorders content:** images in fast's JSON output come AFTER all the paragraphs on a page rather than interleaved at their true y-position. This means an image belonging to AM3394 ends up rendered below AM3030 in the body — a fundamental ordering bug we cannot fix in the converter because the source JSON is already wrong.
- **hybrid mode preserves reading order** (geometric layout is correct: image between AM3394 and AM3030 sits where it should), and **separates AM titles from body descriptions** correctly. But it has its own pathologies the converter has to filter:
  - **OCR-of-screenshot noise:** Docling runs OCR over every embedded image and emits the OCR'd UI labels as flat sibling paragraphs (login form fields, dialog buttons, table cell contents — 100+ noise paragraphs per release note). The converter drops any text element whose bbox center sits inside an image's bbox on the same page. See `collect_image_bboxes` + `is_inside_image`.
  - **Page chrome leak:** Docling does not classify page headers/footers as `header`/`footer` element types. The CAE corporate band ("Jetsched Communications Release Note", "AIR TRANSPORT INFORMATION SYSTEMS", "SAS CYBERJET …", "Page X sur N") and bare metadata fragments (version triple, MM/YYYY date) get emitted as body paragraphs. Filtered by `PAGE_CHROME_PHRASES` substring match + `PAGE_CHROME_RE` exact-match for version/date fragments.
  - **Cyberjet logo:** the small ~72×72pt logo in the top-left of every page is emitted as a body image. Filtered by `is_page_header_logo` (top-of-page position + small bounding box). Logo bboxes are EXCLUDED from the OCR-noise filter so we don't accidentally drop real text that sits just below the logo band.
- **Recurring extractor pathologies still in the output (V8.1.12.0 sample):** even after all filters, hybrid mode still wraps one continuation phrase ("Last valid EOBT", "Correctly displayed on the new column …") that visually belongs to a body paragraph but the extractor classifies as a separate fragment. These are minor and don't break the TOC, but they look ugly in the body. Worth a follow-up iteration.
- **Test data reality:** Only V8.1 PDFs available locally (`patches/ACARS_V8_1/{8.1.11.0,8.1.11.2,8.1.12.0,8.1.12.1,8.1.12.2}/release_notes/`). V7.3 and V8.0 family-difference checks deferred. The 5 V8.0 PDFs in `docs_example/pdf_examples/8.0/` already have pre-extracted fast-mode JSON in `extracted/fast/` which can be reused via the script's `--json` flag without re-running Java.
- **Output artifacts and review workflow:** the script writes both `<output>.docx` and `<output>.md` (the raw extractor markdown, copied from the cache for reference). Current outputs live in `docs_example/conversion_prototype/`:
  - `8.1.12.0.docx` + `.md` — fast mode result
  - `8.1.12.0_hybrid.docx` + `.md` — hybrid mode result
  - `.cache/{fast,hybrid}/<stem>.json` + `<stem>_images/` — extractor caches, reused on subsequent runs unless `--no-cache` is passed.
- **Verdict so far: NOT YET ACCEPTABLE.** Hybrid mode produces a clean enough hierarchy that the Word TOC auto-generates correctly (section → AM-item → bold sub-labels in body) and image ordering is right, but the body is still cluttered enough that the result is "below acceptable workflow quality" per Alex's review on 2026-04-11. Next iterations need to: collapse the orphaned continuation fragments into their parent paragraphs, run the same prototype against AM3030 and AM3388 patches to confirm the cleanup generalizes, and pull a V7.3 / V8.0 sample for family-difference review before declaring go/no-go.

### Unit 5 — Block B integrated

**Effort:** Medium.
**Depends on:** units 3 + 4 (and 4 was a "go").

**Scope.** Move the prototype from unit 4 into `backend/app/pipelines/docs/converter.py`. Plug into the orchestrator after the docs fetcher, so the workflow status flows `downloaded → converted` automatically. Re-conversion is idempotent: re-running on a `converted` or `pending_approval` cell overwrites the DOCX without re-downloading the source PDF.

**Files:**
- `backend/app/pipelines/docs/converter.py` (new) — `convert_to_docx(source_pdf_path, template_path, output_path)`. Wraps the prototype logic in the lifecycle helper (`step_name="convert"`).
- [backend/app/services/orchestrator.py](backend/app/services/orchestrator.py) — call the converter after fetcher succeeds.
- `backend/app/state/models.py` — add `source_pdf_path` and `generated_docx_path` fields on `ReleaseNotesState` (mentioned in §2 Block A/B but not yet on the model).

**Tests.**
- Unit: converter produces a DOCX file from a fixture PDF.
- Integration: full orchestrator pass takes a patch from `not_started` → `discovered` → `downloaded` → `converted` against fixtures.
- Re-conversion: running the converter twice on the same patch overwrites the DOCX.

**Done criteria:** at least one real patch end-to-end in dev produces a `pending_approval` release_notes cell with both files on disk.

---

### Unit 6 — Scan endpoints + scan history persistence

**Effort:** Medium.
**Depends on:** unit 5.

**Scope.** Three new API endpoints + scan history storage. **No UI yet** — endpoints are usable from curl / OpenAPI docs.

**Files:**
- `backend/app/api/pipeline.py` (existing or new) — `POST /scan` (main scan, returns 409 if another main scan is running per the `finished_at IS NULL` check from §4.3), `POST /patches/{id}/release-notes/refetch` (targeted, allowed during a main scan because per-cell lock handles it), `POST /scan/release-notes?version=...` (bulk, calls targeted in a loop).
- `backend/app/state/scan_history.py` (new) — `ScanRecord` Pydantic model + `save_scan_record()` / `is_main_scan_running()` / `list_recent_scans()` helpers. Storage: **`state/scans/<scan_id>.json`** (decided in §5 question 6 — many small files, rotation-friendly, no need to load history into memory for the running-check).
- `backend/app/state/models.py` — add `ScanRecord` model.

**Tests.**
- POST /scan starts a main scan, writes a ScanRecord with `finished_at: null`, second POST /scan immediately returns 409.
- POST /patches/{id}/release-notes/refetch is allowed during a main scan; if the cell is already `running`, returns a clear "already in progress" response.
- Bulk endpoint loops correctly and reports per-cell outcomes.
- `is_main_scan_running()` returns `True` while a scan record has no `finished_at` and `False` after.

**Done criteria:** all three endpoints visible in `/docs` Swagger, exercised with curl in dev, scan records appear in `state/scans/`.

---

### Unit 7 — File serving endpoints

**Effort:** Small.
**Depends on:** unit 5.

**Scope.** Serve the source PDF and generated DOCX for a given patch's release notes. Needed by unit 9's review view. Tiny but isolated so it can ship independently.

**Files:**
- `backend/app/api/patches.py` (existing) — `GET /patches/{id}/release-notes/source.pdf` and `GET /patches/{id}/release-notes/draft.docx`. Both return the file with correct `Content-Type`. 404 if the file doesn't exist on disk.

**Tests.**
- Both endpoints return file content for a fixture patch with both files.
- 404 when files are missing.
- Correct Content-Type headers.

**Done criteria:** `curl -O` against both endpoints downloads usable files in dev.

---

### Unit 8 — UI: additive changes (badge, run indicator, refetch action, detail modal)

**Effort:** Medium.
**Depends on:** unit 6.

**Scope.** All the additive changes to the existing [Pipeline.tsx](frontend/src/views/Pipeline.tsx) and [PatchDetailModal.tsx](frontend/src/components/patches/PatchDetailModal.tsx) **except** the side-by-side review view (that's unit 9). Workflow status badges stay where they are. No layout changes.

**Files:**
- [frontend/src/lib/constants.ts](frontend/src/lib/constants.ts) — add `not_found` entry to `STATUS_CONFIG` with appropriate badge style.
- [frontend/src/lib/types.ts](frontend/src/lib/types.ts) — add `LastRun` type and extend `BinariesState` / `ReleaseNotesState` types to include `last_run`.
- [frontend/src/components/shared/StatusBadge.tsx](frontend/src/components/shared/StatusBadge.tsx) — accept an optional `lastRun` prop, render a small spinner icon when `last_run.state == "running"`, render a small red dot when `last_run.state == "failed"`. Hover on red dot reveals a tooltip with `step`, `error`, `finished_at`. Click on red dot offers "Retry" (calls the targeted refetch endpoint).
- [frontend/src/views/Pipeline.tsx](frontend/src/views/Pipeline.tsx) — pass `last_run` to both `StatusBadge` instances; add a "Refetch Release Notes" action button in the actions area for rows where `release_notes.status ∈ {not_started, not_found}`.
- [frontend/src/components/patches/PatchDetailModal.tsx](frontend/src/components/patches/PatchDetailModal.tsx) — add a "Last run" section per track showing `state`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `step`, `error` when populated.
- [frontend/src/lib/api.ts](frontend/src/lib/api.ts) — add API client functions for `refetchReleaseNotes(patchId)` and the bulk endpoint.

**Tests.** `cd frontend && npm run build` clean. Manual smoke test in dev: a `not_found` patch shows the badge and a working refetch button; a `failed` `last_run` shows the red dot with hover.

**Done criteria:** UI renders all `last_run` states correctly against real backend data; refetch button triggers a real Zendesk lookup end-to-end.

---

### Unit 9 — UI: side-by-side review view

**Effort:** Medium–Large.
**Depends on:** units 7 + 8.

**Scope.** New component for the PDF + DOCX side-by-side review view. Triggered when "Approve Docs" is clicked on a `pending_approval` release-notes cell. This view is a **gate in front of** the existing `JiraApprovalModal`, not a replacement for it.

Flow:
1. Click "Approve Docs" → `DocsReviewView` opens.
2. PDF on the left (pdf.js or `<embed>`, served by unit 7's endpoint).
3. DOCX on the right: since the backend runs on Alex's own machine, the DOCX already exists at a local path. Show the **local file path as copyable text** plus a "Reveal in Finder" affordance (`file://` link or a small backend endpoint that shells `open -R <path>` on macOS). **No download button** — he opens the file directly in Word to tweak it if needed. The unit 7 `draft.docx` endpoint stays available for future remote-backend scenarios and a v2 HTML preview, but is not the primary interaction in v1.
4. "Looks good, continue" button → closes the review view and opens the existing `JiraApprovalModal`, pre-filled for the docs ticket. No new Jira UI — reuse what binaries already uses.
5. Jira modal approve → normal approve endpoint → Unit 10's `approved → pdf_exported → published` flow kicks in on the backend.

The review view itself does **not** advance workflow status — `pending_approval → approved` still happens through the Jira modal + approve endpoint, same pattern as binaries.

**Files:**
- `frontend/src/components/patches/DocsReviewView.tsx` (new) — side-by-side component. Takes a patch, uses unit 7's PDF endpoint for the left pane, shows `release_notes.generated_docx_path` on the right with a reveal-in-finder action. Emits a "continue" callback; the parent (Pipeline.tsx) then opens `JiraApprovalModal`.
- [frontend/src/views/Pipeline.tsx](frontend/src/views/Pipeline.tsx) — chain the existing "Approve Docs" path: open `DocsReviewView` first, then on continue open the existing `JiraApprovalModal`. Binaries "Approve" path is untouched.
- *(optional, if `file://` links prove unreliable in the browser)* `backend/app/api/patches.py` — add `POST /patches/{id}/release-notes/reveal` that runs `subprocess.run(["open", "-R", path])`. macOS-only, dev convenience, fine to skip if a plain `file://` link works.

**Tests.** `npm run build` clean. Manual smoke test: open the review view on a real `pending_approval` patch, see the PDF render, click the path to reveal the DOCX in Finder, open/edit in Word, click continue, see the Jira modal appear pre-filled, approve, confirm state advances through `approved → pdf_exported → published`.

**Done criteria:** end-to-end docs review workflow works against real Zendesk-fetched release notes.

---

### Unit 10 — DOCX → PDF on approval, attached to Jira docs ticket

**Effort:** Small–Medium.
**Depends on:** unit 9.

**Scope.** Final transition. After a docs cell is approved, convert the approved DOCX to PDF and attach the PDF (not the DOCX) to the docs Jira ticket. State: `approved → pdf_exported → published`. This is the only step where the docs flow differs from binaries.

**Files:**
- `backend/app/pipelines/docs/exporter.py` (new) — `export_docx_to_pdf(docx_path) → pdf_path`. Wrap in lifecycle helper (`step_name="pdf_export"`).
- [backend/app/services/patch_service.py](backend/app/services/patch_service.py) — extend the docs approve flow: after approval, call exporter, advance status to `pdf_exported`, then create Jira ticket and attach the PDF, then advance to `published`.
- Tests against fixtures.

**Tests.**
- Unit: exporter produces a valid PDF from a fixture DOCX.
- Integration: full docs approve flow takes a `pending_approval` cell to `published` with a real Jira ticket key and PDF attachment (against a Jira fixture / mock).
- Two-step save: if Jira fails after `pdf_exported`, the cell remains at `pdf_exported` on disk and can be retried.

**Done criteria:** at least one real docs ticket created in dev with a converted PDF attachment.
